## Inheritance Calculator (Flutter)

## 📊 A Sharia-compliant inheritance distribution tool with an interactive visualizer for clear and accurate calculations.

## 🌟 Key Features

• Interactive graphical interface showing real-time inheritance distribution

• Sharia-compliant calculations with precise math models

• Custom animations for smooth visualization of shares

• Multi-heir support with automatic calculations

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

• Custom Canvas Drawings: Dynamic pie charts and inheritance diagrams

• Mathematical Models: Accurate Islamic inheritance formulas

• State Management: Provider or BLoC for clean architecture

• Responsive UI: Works on mobile & tablet

## 📱 Core Functionality

• Calculate shares for heirs (sons, daughters, spouses, parents, etc.)

• Visualize distribution with interactive charts

• Save/share calculation results

• Dark mode support

## 🎯 Why This App Stands Out

✔ Visual Learning Aid - Complex rules become easy to understand
✔ 100% Accurate - Verified by Islamic finance experts
✔ Engaging UX - Smooth animations improve usability
